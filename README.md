<h3>Collaboration of M250 students (please add yourself to this list)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Joel Peyton</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>GUIDELINES</h3>
<p>For those interested in collaborating please take time to read these short guidelines</p>
<ol>
  <li>This may well be a case of the blind leading the blind, so please don't be afraid to speak up if you think we can do things better.</li>
  <li>That said, let's try and keep to the orginal design style and colours, unless there is a real concensus that the original is shockingly bad.</li>
  <li>Let's try and keep to a coding convention, indents 4 spaces, whitespace, comments if needed, etc.  Take a look at the original files if you're not sure.</li>
  <li>Check out the todo list, these are tasks that need doing.  I'll keep them small so that they are acheivable.</li>
  <li>If you undertake a task, update the list by striking it through and putting your name against it.</li>
  <li>Likewise, if you can't do the task make it available, or ask for help.</li>
  <li>Please don't undertake more than one task at time, thus allowing for more people to contribute.</li>
  <li>By all means fork it and do it yourself if you want.</li>
  <li>And finally, I setup this project up to help with understanding github and working with others. We are all learning, so let's help each other out where possible.</li>  
</ol>

<h3>OBJECTIVE / DESIGN LAYOUT</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Utilise original files to make a workable puzzle</li>
  <li>Vertical menu that contains game functionality</li>
  <li>Horizontal menu with numbers 1 through 9 that are used to populate board</li>
</ol>

<h3>TODO LIST</h3>
<p>This is by no means everything to do and will be very organic</p>
<p><strong>NOTE&nbsp;</strong>Think we will need to work on design layout of the game, ie HTML/CSS before we can start working on the functionality</p>

<h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Design vertical menu / buttons, think about what items we might, ie new game, levels, hints, check for mistakes etc</li>
  <li>Design horizontal buttons, with numbers 1 through 9</li>
  <li><strike>Change header with new title and something that shows collaboration rather than individual piece of work</strike>&nbsp;<em>Joel Peyton</em></li>
</ol>

<H4>Javascript</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Make vertical menu items clickable - This will need to wait until we know what they do</li>
  <li>Make individual squares obtain focus for input</li>
  <li>Make horizontal buttons populate board</li>
</ol>
